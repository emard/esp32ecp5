# RBP onboard programmer

Use onboard FJC-ESP32-V0r2 module.

    JTAG  GPIO
     TMS   4
     TCK  16
     TDI  15
     TDO   2

This module currently has ESP32-WROOM (without PSRAM expansion),
so writing to FLASH doesn't work. ESP32-WROVER-E module is required.

There is no free RAM to handle buffering for 64KB FLASH
erase blocks. 4KB erase block mode can't be used because it doesn't
work correctly on SPANSION 32MB (256Mbit) FLASH chip.

There's no free RAM for on-the-fly decompression of jtagspi
bitstream required for flashing ARTIX-7.

# FFM external programmer

Connect ESP32-WROVER-E (on FROGO board) with female-female wires
to 10-pin header on FFM board.

Pinout:

    ESP32
    GPIO JTAG  ------
      18  TCK | 1  2 |
      34  TDO | 3  4 | 3.3V
       5  TMS   5  6 | 
              | 7  8 |
      23  TDI | 9 10 | GND
               ------

# ECP-5

ecp5.prog() and ecp5.flash() work at ESP32-WROVER.
FLASH write should use 64KB erase block, change in ecp5.py:

    flash_erase_size = const(65536)

FLASH doesn't work at ESP32-WROOM for it can't buffer 64KB erase blocks.
jtagspi bypass bitstream is not needed for ECP5. 

To use external programmer (ESP32) instead of onboard FT4232,
4 switches near 14-pin connector have to be
all in position away from 14-pin connector.
To use onboard FT4232, 4 switches have to be
all in position towrads 14-pin connector.

# ARTIX-7

artix7.prog() uses normal "bit" binary bitstreams.
To write bitstream to config FLASH, ESP32-WROVER can use bscan
bitstream (jtag-spi passthru) for xc3sprog
[bscan7.bit
source](https://github.com/f32c/f32c/tree/master/rtl/proj/xilinx/ffm-a7100/ffm_a7100_jtag_spi_bridge),
compressed with "gzip -9" and named with idcode for example:

    jtagspi%08x.bit.gz % idcode
    
    jtagspi13631093.bit.gz

# CYCLONE-V

cyclone5.prog() uses raw bitstream which should be extracted
from "svf" file using "cyclone5_svf2bit.py" tool which does
byte-reverse and bit-reverse in each byte:

    cyclone5_svf2bit.py bitstream.svf bitstream.bit

Currently wiritng to FLASH at CYCLONE-V is not yet supported,
Still looking for protocol docs/specs or code example that writes
FLASH thru JTAG.
